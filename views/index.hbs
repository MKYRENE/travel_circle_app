<h1>Travel Circle</h1>

<p>
    Share your travel details with your chosen group.  Travel Circle allows travel details to be private and not available to the general public.  It allows the selected users to know where you are and what you have done as soon as you post, as well as seeing your up to date photos.  Don't let anyone outside of your circle know that you are not home.

<p>
    Instead of searching through your phone or all the different social media for your trip photos or details they are kept on a seperate app allowing easy access.
