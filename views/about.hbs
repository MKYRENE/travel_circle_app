<h1>About Us</h1>


<h2>Our Story</h2>
<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>
    Travel Circle is a collaboration of 4 coding students that took the concept of social media and adapted it to be used for sharing travel details.  
    We wanted a concept that could be used to share location, photos, and experiences with a select group.  We use login authentication and cloud storage for your photos to keep your details safe.
</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>
    In the future we plan on adding "The Next Stop" page to allow users to post where they are going next. We are also looking into push notifications for new posts.  We woud like to add a details section to allow users to enter information regarding air fare, hotels, and ground transportation to save for future reference.
