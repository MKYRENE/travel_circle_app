    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>
        <h6>Share your travel details with a chosen group.</h6>
    </p>
    <p> 
        Travel Circle allows travel details to be private and not available to the general public. It lets the selected users know where you are and what you have done as soon as you post, as well as seeing your up-to-date photos. Don't let anyone outside of your circle know that you are not home.
    </p>
    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>
        Instead of searching through your phone and all of your different social media for your trip photos or details, they are kept on a dedicated app allowing easy access.
